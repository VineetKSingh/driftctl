## Why driftctl ?

Infrastructure drift is a blind spot and a source of potential security issues.
Drift can have multiple causes: from team members creating or updating infrastructure through the web console without backporting changes to Terraform, to unexpected actions from authenticated apps and services. 

You can't efficiently improve what you don't track. We track coverage for unit tests, why not infrastructure as code coverage?

Spot discrepancies as they happen: driftctl is a free and open-source CLI that warns of infrastructure drifts and fills in the missing piece in your DevSecOps toolbox.


## Features

- **Scan** cloud provider and map resources with IaC code
- Analyze diffs, and warn about drift and unwanted unmanaged resources
- Allow users to **ignore** resources
- Multiple output formats
